## CSS Grid Layout Module

### Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>

  <div class="grid-item">7</div>
  <div class="grid-item">8</div>

### Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its `display` property is set to grid or inline-grid.

```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}

.grid-container {
  display: inline-grid;
}
```

#### Grid Columns
The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.

# JavaScript RegExp Reference

## RegExp Object
A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters.

Regular expressions are used to perform pattern-matching and "`search-and-replace`" functions on text.

```
var patt = /w3schools/i
```

**/w3schools/i**  is a regular expression.
**w3schools**  is a pattern (to be used in a search).
**i**  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).
