# Responsive Web Design
Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their website. It’s practically essential after all: one design for the BlackBerry, another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must be compatible, too. In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop? It won’t, of course.

## What Is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.


Obviously, we can’t use motion sensors and robotics to accomplish this the way a building would. Responsive Web design requires a more abstract way of thinking. However, some ideas are already being practiced: fluid layouts, media queries and scripts that can reformat Web pages and mark-up effortlessly (or automatically).

But responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and automatically resizable images, but rather about a whole new way of thinking about design. Let’s talk about all of these features, plus additional ideas in the making.

## Adjusting Screen Resolution
With more devices come varying screen resolutions, definitions and orientations. New devices with new screen sizes are being developed every day, and each of these devices may be able to handle variations in size, functionality and even color. Some are in landscape, others in portrait, still others even completely square. As we know from the rising popularity of the iPhone, iPad and advanced smartphones, many new devices are able to switch from portrait to landscape at the user’s whim. How is one to design for these situations?

### Flexible Images
One major problem that needs to be solved with responsive Web design is working with images

``` 
img { max-width: 100%; }
```
The maximum width of the image is set to 100% of the screen or browser width

### Flexible Layouts
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as `width`, `margin`, or `padding`.


#### Relative Viewport Lengths
`vw` Viewports width
`vh` Viewports height
`vmin` Minimum of the viewport’s height and width
`vmax` Maximum of the viewport’s height and width

### Flexible Grid

**HTML**
```
<div class="container">
  <section>...</section>
  <aside>...</aside>
</div>

```

**CSS**
```
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px ÷ 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px ÷ 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px ÷ 538px = .293680297 */
}

```


### Media Queries#media-queries

```
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```

Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions. Common media types include `all`, `screen`, `print`, `tv`, and `braille`. The HTML5 specification includes new media types, even including `3d-glasses`. Should a media type not be specified the media query will default the media type to `screen`.

### Logical Operators in Media Queries

Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

```
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

@media not screen and (color) {...}

@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}

```


# CSS Layout - float and clear

The CSS `float` property specifies how an element should float.

The CSS `clear` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

## The float Property
The `float` property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The `float` property can have one of the following values:

1. `left` - The element floats to the left of its container
1. `right` - The element floats to the right of its container
1. `none` - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
1. `inherit` - The element inherits the float value of its parent

In its simplest use, the `float` property can be used to wrap text around images.

#### Example - float: right;
```
img {
  float: right;
}
```


#### Example - float: left;
```
img {
  float: left;
}
```

### CSS Layout - clear and clearfix

***The clear Property***

The `clear` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

The `clear` property can have one of the following values:

1. `none` - Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default
1. `left` - No floating elements allowed on the left side
1. `right`- No floating elements allowed on the right side
1. `both` - No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side
1. `inherit` - The element inherits the clear value of its parent

When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

The following example clears the `float` to the `left`. Means that no floating elements are allowed on the left side (of the div):

```
div {
  clear: left;
}
```
